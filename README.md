# Minimal Essentials

> A minimal "essentials" skin for [VirtualDJ][virtualdj].

This skin is derived from the default [VirtualDJ][virtualdj] "Essentials" skin and includes modifications intended to streamline the user interface by removing functionality which is less commonly used in non-mixing contexts (e.g., when DJing at a salsa dance social).

Notably, the skin does not include elements for

-   effects
-   looping
-   padding
-   scratching

as these elements are more common in traditional club contexts.
